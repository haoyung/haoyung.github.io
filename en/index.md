Hi, I’m [Hao-Yung Weng](https://haoyungweng.me).

My coffee journey began as the director of the [student coffee club at National Taiwan University](https://instagram.com/ntu.coffee). Even after graduating and pursuing a master’s degree at Carnegie Mellon, I’ve stayed close with the club—they’re my best friends. We prided ourselves on being highly research-driven. We read blog posts and research papers, hosted cupping sessions, and meticulously documented our brews.

Years of exploration have given me insights that, while not definitive, seem worth sharing. This blog, “whycoffee.blog”—inspired by my initials “WHY”—is where I do that. The name also invites reflection: What draws us to coffee? Is it exploring unique flavors, or the joy of discussing coffee with others?

When hosting events, I often talk about the “connections between people” that coffee creates. Each bean travels a long road—from cultivation and harvesting to processing and roasting—that links everyone involved. I like to say, “Notice how coffee connects us—you and me, right here and now.”

It’s that very connection I hope to share with you, dear reader.
