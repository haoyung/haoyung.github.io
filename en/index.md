Hi, I'm [Hao-yung Weng](https://haoyungweng.me).

My coffee journey began in college, where I served as president and later advisor of the [student coffee club at National Taiwan University](https://instagram.com/ntu.coffee). Now, while pursuing graduate studies in the US, I stay connected with the club and occasionally provide remote technical support. We pride ourselves on being research-driven: reading papers, hosting cupping sessions, and carefully [measuring]({% link _posts/en/2024-04-19-Precisely Measuring TDS.md %}) and documenting our brews. We are always asking how we can improve.

Years of exploration have given me insights that, while not definitive, feel worth sharing. This blog, *whycoffee.blog*, is a play on my initials "WHY" and a prompt for reflection. Why coffee? Is it about exploring the unique flavors of different origins? Or geeking out with fellow enthusiasts?

When hosting events, I often talk about how coffee creates connection. Each bean travels a long road—from cultivation and harvesting to processing and roasting—that links everyone involved. I like to tell my audience: “Notice how coffee connects us—you and me—right here.”

That's the connection I hope to share with you here.
